#### This step is completely unnessary for all/most users. This is just here to help **me** when I want to resetup this config.

- Install and configure kanata, a keyboard remapping program
```bash
cargo install kanata
sudo cp ~/.cargo/bin/kanata /usr/bin/kanata
sudo mkdir /etc/kanata/
sudo cp ~/fibreglass/.config/kanata/config.kbd /etc/kanata/config.kbd
sudo cp ~/fibreglass/.config/kanata/kanata.service /lib/systemd/system/kanata.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable kanata
sudo systemctl start kanata
```

- Install and configure helix, a nvim-like editor.
First, go [here](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/releases/latest) and download the `tar.xz` for your computer
Then:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
unxz ./helix-*-linux.tar.xz
tar -xf ./helix-*-linux.tar
cd ./helix-*-linux
sudo cp ./hx /usr/bin/hx
cp -r ./runtime ~/fibreglass/.config/helix/
```

## Known Issues

### Notifications with no text, appname, or time appear with the default notification icon.

| Key | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | This issue is a well known issue with quickshell's notification server. It involves these "ghost" notifications, which are notifications that haven't been properly removed by the notification server. |
| **Timing** | This happens mostly while I'm editing code, so it shouldn't effect the user |
| **Workaround** | Force quickshell to discard all the notifications by clicking on the dashboard's "Clear" button. |
